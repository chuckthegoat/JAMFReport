JAMFReport.py

JAMFReport utilizes the JAMF API to generate a report of your install broken down by site.

The tool has 2 major components:
	1. Downloads the payloads of every configuration profile and saves them by name and sorted into categories under each site
	2. Generates a scoping report for each site showing how what policies/configs are scoped to the group, as well as
	various group interdependancies.

To use JAMFReport edit the config.py file, filling in the USERNAME, PASSWORD, APIURL, and BACKUP_ROOT variables with your organization's credentials.
Then, simply run 'python JAMFReport.py'. The script may take some time to run as it will be making many API calls, but after exiting your BACKUP_ROOT
should contain the scoping information described above.
